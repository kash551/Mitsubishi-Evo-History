    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, popularly referred to as the 'Evo',[1] is a sports sedan and rally car based on the Lancer that was manufactured by Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi Motors from 1992 until 2016. There have been ten official versions to date, and the designation of each model is most commonly a Roman numeral. All generations use two-litre intercooled turbo inline four-cylinder engines and all-wheel drive systems.[2]

        The Lancer was originally intended only for Japanese markets, but demand on the "grey import" market led the Evolution series to be offered through Ralliart dealer networks in the United Kingdom and in various European markets from around 1998. Mitsubishi decided to export the eighth generation Evolution to the United States in 2003 after witnessing the success Subaru had in that market the previous year with the Subaru Impreza WRX.
        
        All domestic-market versions, until the release of the Evolution IX in 2005, were limited by a gentlemen's agreement between Japanese car manufacturers to advertise no more than 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp). However, sources say Mitsubishi had already been producing cars with more power but had been underrating the official power outputs in order to comply with the agreement.[3] Therefore, each subsequent version has unofficially evolved above the advertised power figures, with the Japanese-market Evolution IX reaching an alleged output of around 321 PS (236 kW; 317 hp). Various special versions available in other markets, particularly the UK, have official power outputs up to 446 PS (328 kW; 440 hp).
        
        The tenth and final generation of the Lancer Evolution, the Evolution X, was launched in Japan in 2007, and overseas markets in 2008. The Evolution X was produced for almost 10 years until Mitsubishi retired the Lancer Evolution in April 2016.
