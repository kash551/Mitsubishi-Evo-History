    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        Acknowledge him!

        For some, bearing the responsibility of one of wrestling's most storied families would break even the strongest Superstar. For Roman Reigns, it was just another day at the office. Or another day at The Head of the Table.
        
        The agile, imposing juggernaut has been told his entire life that he cannot accomplish his goals. And since day one of his arrival in WWE, he has proven his naysayers wrong in the language of broken bodies and shattered Superstars who thought they had his number.
        
        Whether it was finishing opposing teams as the enforcer of The Shield or steadily grinding his way toward several early reigns as WWE Champion, Reigns always left a lasting impression on anyone who came in contact with him. The intense Superstar proved himself while forging his path as a singles competitor and has never turned away from a challenge, battling everyone from Brock Lesnar to John Cena to Triple H to a WrestleMania showdown with The Undertaker that brought the legendary Deadman only his second loss at The Showcase of the Immortals.
